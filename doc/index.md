# encoding3d

**One file format for whole plant-model scenes, shared by the FSPM platforms.**

Functional-structural plant models (FSPM) are written on several platforms: openalea.metafspm (Python), CPlantBox
(C++), GroIMP (Java) and VirtualPlantLab (Julia). encoding3d lets them exchange what they simulate. A file holds a whole
scene at one time step:

- **the plants:** their organs and elements at every scale, from the plant down to the cell, and how they connect;
- **their variables and parameters**, each with its unit, its kind and a shared standard name;
- **their geometry**, as triangles;
- **the environment:** soil grids, and which soil cells each root element lies in.

A simulation writes one file per time step. Any platform can read them back. ParaView, Blender or any glTF viewer
can display them. Platforms can also run their models together, step by step, exchanging their values through the
same format ([Coupling platforms](coupling.md)).

The files are glTF 2.0 binaries (`.glb`): the 3D format of the web and of most viewers, extended with typed tables.
