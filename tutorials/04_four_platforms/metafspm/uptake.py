"""
Tutorial 4, metafspm's side: root water uptake (functional, a toy). metafspm has no plant of its own here: it joins
the session and builds its data structure from the roots CPlantBox grows (RemoteComponent.join), then its component
computes each segment's uptake from its surface and the plant's carbon status (the more the leaves assimilate, the more
the roots take up), at each step.
