# Tutorial 2d: GroIMP

**What you learn:** how a GroIMP graph (its nodes, their managed fields, the plant's scales and its `>` and `+`
edges) is written as encoding3d frames, and turned back into GroIMP nodes; and how GroIMP users export a whole
project, with its 3D geometry, from GroIMP itself.

**What you need** (not encoding3d's requirements): Java 21 and Maven. The program uses GroIMP's Graph module, from
GroIMP's package registry (no GroIMP application), and GroIMP's adapter (`bindings/java/groimp/`), a proposal for
GroIMP kept in this repository until GroIMP adopts it.

**How to run it:** `./run.sh`. It installs encoding3d's Java codec and GroIMP's adapter in Maven's local repository,
then compiles and runs the program (`src/main/java/tutorial/`), which writes its files in `outputs/`. It is in three
parts:

1. **A GroIMP plant.** Node classes as an RGG model declares them: a `Plant`, `Internode`s and `Leaf`s, whose fields
   GroIMP manages (`Managed.java` declares them, as GroIMP's XL compiler does for a model's classes). The plant is
   made of its internodes (a `/` edge), each internode followed by the next (`>`) and bearing a leaf (`+`). It grows
   by code standing for an RGG rule: a new internode and leaf on top, every leaf longer.
   GroIMP's graph module has no geometry: in the GroIMP application, shape nodes (cylinders, …) place the organs in
   space, and the plugin meshes them (below). So that viewers can draw this plant, each organ keeps its two ends
   (`x1` … `z2`, declared as the vocabulary's `proximal_end_x` … `distal_end_z`): the internodes stacked upwards, the
   leaves leaning out to alternate sides.
2. **A frame per step.** `GroImp.toDataStructure` writes the plant and its organs as two entity sets, the edges as
   `parent` and `edge_type`, the managed fields as columns (`length` and `radius` declared in metres). Six steps make
   a sequence.
3. **Back into GroIMP.** `GroImp.toGraph` rebuilds each row as a node of its class, its fields set.

Open `outputs/frames/scene.fspm.json` in ParaView with encoding3d's plugin (tutorial 1): the stem and its leaves,
drawn from their ends, grow step by step.

## From GroIMP itself: the plugin

GroIMP's encoding3d plugin (`bindings/java/groimp-plugin/`, also a proposal for GroIMP) exports a GroIMP project with
its geometry: in GroIMP, **File > Export** of the 3D view to a `.glb` file, or headless, the command `export3d
plant.glb`. Its README says how to build and install it; `bindings/java/groimp-plugin/test/run_in_groimp.sh` grows
GroIMP's `simpleRapeseed` example headless and exports a frame after each of four runs, a log other platforms can
replay (tutorial 3).

Try it yourself: add a field `area` to the leaves, manage it, declare it in `m2`, and check it in the frames with
`encoding3d info outputs/frames/frame_000005.glb`.
