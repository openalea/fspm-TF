# fspm-TF

**One file format for whole plant-model scenes, shared by the FSPM platforms.**

Functional-structural plant models (FSPM) are written on several platforms: openalea.metafspm (Python), CPlantBox
(C++), GroIMP (Java) and VirtualPlantLab (Julia). fspm-TF lets them exchange what they simulate. A file holds a whole
scene at one time step:

- **the plants:** their organs and elements at every scale, from the plant down to the cell, and how they connect;
- **their variables and parameters**, each with its unit, its kind and a shared standard name;
- **their geometry**, as triangles;
- **the environment:** soil grids, and which soil cells each root element lies in.

A simulation writes one file per time step. Any platform can read them back. ParaView, Blender or any glTF viewer
can display them.

The files are glTF 2.0 binaries (`.glb`): the 3D format of the web and of most viewers, extended with typed tables.
