"""
The Python codec's run of the conformance check, as every codec does it in its CI: read each conformance GLB and dump
it as JSON (OUT/dumps/x.json for x.glb), and write the conformance scenes again as GLB files (OUT/written/x.glb).
Then .github/actions/conformance compares the dumps with the expected values and validates the written files.
