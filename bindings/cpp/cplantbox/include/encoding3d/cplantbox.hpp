// CPlantBox's adapter: an organism (a Plant, a RootSystem, a MappedPlant) as an encoding3d graph, its leaves' and
// stems' geometry as a mesh, its soil grid and segment-to-cell mapping; and back, a graph (CPlantBox's, or another
// platform's) as a static CPlantBox root system.
//
// Status: a first proposal for CPlantBox's team to take over, not a part of encoding3d: encoding3d's requirements and CI do not depend on it;
// it is built and tested by hand (bindings/cpp/cplantbox/README.md), and moves into CPlantBox once its team adopts it.

// coarser entity set its complex points to, whatever their names and ranks (see to_root_system).
