    encoding3d

Reading and writing encoding3d files in Julia: whole functional-structural plant model scenes (multiscale plant graphs,
their variables and parameters, their geometry, the environment's grids) at successive time steps, one glTF 2.0
binary (GLB) file per time step. The specification is `spec/specification.md` in the encoding3d repository.

    read_frame(path) -> Frame             write_frame(path, frame)
    from_bytes(data) -> Frame             to_bytes(frame) -> Vector{UInt8}
    read_index(path), read_sequence(path) write_sequence(directory, frames)
    frame_to_dict(frame), write_dump(path, frame)     the layout of the conformance files' expected values

With MultiScaleTreeGraph loaded, `from_mtg` and `to_mtg` convert an MTG to and from a data structure. With
VirtualPlantLab's PlantGraphs loaded, `from_graph` and `to_graph` convert its graphs; with PlantGeomTurtle too,
`add_geometry!` adds a graph's turtle geometry as a mesh.

A platform takes part in a coupling session (specification §11) with `Participant(declaration)`, then answers each of
`turns(participant)` with `send_update(participant, frame)`; over a folder ("files:path"), or ZeroMQ with ZMQ loaded.
