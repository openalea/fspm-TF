# Conformance files

The specification as test cases for every codec. Each scene is a frame (`x.glb`) and its expected values
(`x.expected.json`); `growing_sequence/` is a sequence with its index. `generate.py` writes them all from fixed
numbers, the same bytes on every run; the CI checks that the committed files are what it writes.

| Scene | Covers |
|---|---|
| `root_system` | Plant, Axis and SubOrgan scales, MTG relations, segment variables, a mesh representing three scales, scalars |
| `wheat_shoot` | Plant, Axis, Organ and SubOrgan scales, leaf quads, NaN through `noData`, a translated origin |
| `section_cells` | a cell network: an entity set and a relation with ids, labels and conductances; text and vector columns; extras |
| `soil_and_roots` | a root system, a regular soil grid with z pointing down, and their mapping |
| `adaptive_soil` | an adaptive grid's leaf cells (`level`, `index`) |
| `parameter_set` | a `table` data structure: parameters per plant and in the scalars, references, an infinite value |
| `growing_sequence/` | three frames of a growing root system, ids kept, and their index |

## The expected values

`x.expected.json` is the frame `x.glb` holds, as plain JSON (written by `openalea.fspm_tf.dump.frame_to_dict`):

```text
{"time": 0.0, "time_unit": "d", "step": 0,
 "data_structures": [
   {"id": "...", "kind": "graph", "origin": [[4 numbers] x 4, row by row], "platform": "...", "model": "...",
    "extras": {...},                                                    (when present)
    "entity_sets": [{"name": "SubOrgan", "rank": 6, "count": 10,
                     "columns": {"id": {"dtype": "int64", "values": [...]},
                                 "label": {"dtype": "string", "values": [...]},      (labels and enums as their names)
                                 "end": {"dtype": "float64", "values": [[x, y, z], ...]}, ...},
                     "variables": {"length": {"unit": "m", "role": "state", "standard_name": "length",
                                              "kind": "extensive", "description": "..."}, ...}}],
    "relations": [... like entity sets, with "source_set" and "target_set"],
    "scalars": {... like an entity set, one row},
    "grid": {"kind", "shape", "origin", "spacing", "axes", "periodic", "z_up", "max_level", "cells"},
    "meshes": [{"name": "...", "positions_float32": [[x, y, z], ...], "feature_rows": {"SubOrgan": [...]},
                "indices": [...], "display": {"name": [...]}}]}],
 "mappings": [... like entity sets, with "source", "target" ([data structure, entity set]) and "method"]}
```

- **Floats** are the shortest decimals giving the same double, compared exactly.
- **NaN** is `null`; +∞ and −∞ are the strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"`.
- **Positions** are the FLOAT32 values of the file, widened to doubles.
- **`dtype`** is the column's numpy type name (`float64`, `int64`, `uint8`, `bool`...), or `string` for text and enums.
- Keys only appear when the frame has them (no `extras`, `relations`, `scalars`, `grid` or `meshes` when absent).

## Checking a codec

1. The codec reads each `x.glb` and dumps what it read in this layout as `DUMPS/x.json` (same relative path).
2. It writes the same scenes back as GLB files, in `WRITTEN/`.
3. Then:

   ```bash
   fspm-tf compare-all DUMPS conformance          # reading: every dump equals its expected values
   fspm-tf validate WRITTEN/*.glb                 # writing: valid fspm-TF (and Khronos' glTF-Validator: valid glTF)
   ```

In GitHub Actions, the composite action `.github/actions/conformance` runs both. The Python codec's own run is
`bindings/python/conformance_run.py`, used by the `python-codec-conformance` job of `.github/workflows/conformance.yml`.
